            <span>Dimitria Albright (Elisetta)</span> received her musical training at Longy School of Music, and performed in the Boston area with organizations such as Opera del West, Cambridge Summer Opera. Music is Art, and the Beethoven Society. She then moved to Greece and Italy where she extensively retrained in singing technique and interpretation.

            She was thrilled to perform with DVOC last year in a modern work,Take My Otherness, which included singing and speaking in Greek, and in their production of Susannah. This year she is greatly looking forward to the opportunity to sing a role where the character isn’t very nice—a rare opportunity for a lyric soprano!
            
            She currently lives in the Philadelphia area, and in her free time she likes to play chess.".
